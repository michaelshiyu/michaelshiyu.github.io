**This site is under construction...**

* I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida under the supervision of [Dr. Jose Principe](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/jose-c-principe/). 

* My research focuses on deep learning theory and computer vision. 

    - Right now, I am mainly working on making deep architectures more **transparent** (or interpretable, if you are more familiar with the terminologies within the community) and more **secure** (adversarially robust).

    - I also have experience with both low-level (denoising, superresolution, deblurring, etc.) and high-level (object recognition, detection, segmentation, etc.) **computer vision**, **generative models** (GANs in particular), and **reinforcement learning**. And I am interested in math and statistics in general. 

* I am lucky to have been advised by some truly exceptional researchers during internships including: [Dr. Jinwei Gu](https://www.gujinwei.org/), [Dr. Huaijin (George) Chen](http://hc25.web.rice.edu/). 

* When I have time, I contribute to open-source projects. Some of the projects I contribute to are listed in [Projects](https://michaelshiyu.github.io/projects/).
