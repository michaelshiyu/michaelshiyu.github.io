* I am currently a machine learning engineer/research at Apple working on images and videos.

* I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Florida under the supervision of [Dr. Jose Principe](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/jose-c-principe/). 

* My Ph.D. research focused on deep learning theory and computer vision. 

    - I worked on making deep architectures more **modular** (think the kind of modularization in object-oriented programming), more **label efficient** (un/semi-supervised learning, transfer learning), more **transparent** (or interpretable, if you are more familiar with the terminologies within the community), and more **secure** (adversarially robust).

    - I also worked on both low-level (super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, etc.) and high-level (object recognition, detection, segmentation, etc.) **computer vision**, **image/video compression**, **generative models** (GANs in particular), and **reinforcement learning**. And I am interested in math and statistics in general.
