## FixMatch: Simplifying Semi-Supervised Learning with Consistency and Confidence

**keywords:** semi-supervised learning, image classification

**code:** [available](github.com/google-research/fixmatch)

**datasets:** CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, STL-10, ImageNet

**one-sentence summary:** Combines two existing semi-supervised learning techniques, consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, in a simplistic way but achieves state-of-the-art results (in particular, 94.93%/88.61% on CIFAR-10 with 250/40 labels). 

**main method:** Is essentially a loss function of two terms: cross-entropy on weakly augmented labeled examples (Eq. 3) and cross-entropy on strongly augmented, unlabeled examples using (only confident enough) model predictions (on weakly augmented versions of these images) as artificial labels (Eq. 4). 

**additional comments:** Nice literature review. Very detailed descriptions on the experimental settings. Extensive ablation study.
